# Dotfiles

This repository contains my current dev setup. I plan on documenting the way I use it and the resources that helped me along the way.

# Installation

To install the dotfiles you can use this shell script based on the awesome guide about [storing dotfiles by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles). Of course make sure to review it's contents first 😁

```
curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hishpeck/dotfiles/refs/heads/master/install.sh | /bin/bash
```
